Welcome to my data section! Here you will find a list of popular databases I frequently share with others along with general popular databases used by most in the industry.
I have them broken out by Government Databases, Non-Government Databases, and Financial Calculators.

[Government Databases](https://andrewaferrante.github.io/data/government-databases/) include a list of primary source databases with data collected by federal, state, and local governments. These are considered gold standard quality data in the industry.

[Non-Government Databases](https://andrewaferrante.github.io/data/non-government-databases/) are databases organized by nonprofits, private companies, or non-government organizations. Some are as widely used as government databases and even use government data themselves.

[Financial Calculators](https://andrewaferrante.github.io/data/financial-calculators/) is not a list of places to find data, but more of a source of helpful calculators you can use for personal finances.

All the resources come from my ever growing list of bookmarked resources, so more will be added as the years go by!



I am planning to add more, but in the time being feel free to check out the code for this website [here](https://github.com/AndrewAFerrante/AndrewAFerrante.github.io)!
