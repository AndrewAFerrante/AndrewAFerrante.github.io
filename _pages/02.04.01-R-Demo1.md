In this demonstration, I will go over some basic R syntax as well as how to start utilizing some of the most popular R packages! Remember, all this functionality is completely free!

### Task: Download excel workbooks from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and clean them into one combined excel workbook.

We will start my downloading *four seperate* excel workbooks from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Follow [this link](https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/surveymost?bls) and click the check boxes for the following labor data series indicators in the "Employment" section:

- Civilian Labor Force (Seasonally Adjusted) - LNS11000000
- Civilian Employment (Seasonally Adjusted) - LNS12000000
- Civilian Unemployment (Seasonally Adjusted) - LNS13000000
- Unemployment Rate (Seasonally Adjusted) - LNS14000000

Then scroll down to the bottom of the page and click "Retrieve data". 

You can see all of the four labor labor indicators you chose appear in nice little tables and allow for you to download each of the indicators into their own excel workbook. Download them all and save them in their own folder somewhere with their own unique names. This is where I am going to save my files and what I am going to name them:

- Location: C:\Users\Owner\Documents

- Civilian Labor Force.xlsx
- Civilian Employment.xlsx
- Civilian Unemployment.xlsx
- Unemployment Rate.xlsx
