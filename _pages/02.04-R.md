Welcome to the R portion of the website. Below are instructions to download the appropriate material so you can get setup and ready to use R! A few quick examples/demonstrations of what you can do are also listed below.

### How to Download and Install R and RStudio

In order to start using all the capibilities of the data science tool R, we need to make sure we download and install the proper software first. We are going to need to download two things: R and RStudio. 

R is the coding software, it has full functionality to be used, but it is lacking some features. We will refer to R by itself as **base R**. Think of **base R** as the Notepad software that comes with your operating system. It is fully capable of being used to write text, however, it is missing a lot of extra features such as changing font types and sizes, adding photos, adding headers and footers, and more. In order to get this additional functionality, we will need to download and install RStudio.

RStudio allows you to write R code with much more functionality. With RStudio, you can view plots, open multiple files, change color scheme, open files, and more! Going back to the Notepad anaolgy, think of **base R** as the Notepad and RStudio as Microsoft Word. This distinction should easily describe why we need both software in order to use R in the most optimal way.

Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-RrkJQQYqY) and read this [article](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html) to familiarize yourself a little better with the software. I encourage you to search online for additional information if you want to learn more! (The internet is your friend when you have questions with coding software!)

Congrats! You have just taken your first step to be a data scientist! You are doing great!

After installing and booting everything up for the first time, things may seem a little overwhelming, do I recommend watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIrsOBy5k58) that explains the four main panels in RStudio and some basic things to do.

I also would like to add that it is popular practice in data science to change the
